# RC_Car_Mk1_ws
The objective is to make a simulated RC car to master the basics of gazebo and URDF files.

## Summary
This ws wasn't a success. 
  - I tried to use Ubuntu 24.04 with ROS2 Jazzy but the drivers I needed hadn't come out yet.
  - I also diverged from the tutorials too much which only complicated my task.
  - The setup wasn't ideal either.

I will resolve these issues in the next version of the ws, called RC_Car_Mk2_ws.
